            WARNING:  This div must be below the 100% height of the page this 
            way screen will be locked with above divs and this one will be
            hidden at a first glance, and user will only be able to scroll down 
            when they scroll while pressing mouse 2 button.
            That is needed because user may scroll down within whiteboard to 
            reach out further tasks notes.
